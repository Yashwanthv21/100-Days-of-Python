# 100-Days-of-Python
DataStructures and Algorithms using Python

## Day 1 - Selection Sort

- Selection Sort is one of the simplest sorting technique.
- The smallest element is selected in each iteration and swapped with current value, this is continued until the entire list is parsed.

## Day 2 - Quick Sort

- The fastest sort as the name suggests.

## Day 3 - Merge Sort

- Divides the list into small parts and sorts them and combines them to form a sorted list.

## Day 4 - Insertion Sort

- Compares each element with its left and swaps the positon accordingly.

## Day 5 - DFS Binary Tree

- All 3 traversals of binary tree.

## Day 6 - BFS Binary Tree

- Breadth First Search on a Binary Tree.

## Day 7 - DFS Graph

- depth-first search on a graph

## Day 8 - Decorators in Python

- Decorators are used to abstract out code from functions.

## Day 9 - BFS Graph

- BFS on a graph
